# Codes for the chaotic Gene Ragulation Model
- ddefun.m: The delayed differential equation function for the model
- standard_RC.m: Repreducing the dynamics prediction of the chaotic gene regulation model with a standard non-delayed RC of dimension 600
- DelayedRC.m: Repreducing the dynamics prediction of the chaotic gene regulation model with a delayed RC including 6 neurons and 100 lags for each neuron
- DelayedRC_singlenode.m: Repreducing the dynamics prediction of the chaotic gene regulation model  with a single neuron RC with 600 lags
