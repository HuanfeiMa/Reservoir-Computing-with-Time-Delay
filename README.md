# Delayed-Reservoir-Computing

Simplified code for: Embedding Theory of Reservoir Computing and Reducing Reservoir Network Using Time Delays

We developed codes for standard reservoir computing and delayed reservoir computing for
- Gene regulation model
- ISCAM
- Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation(KSE)
- Lorenz system
- Mackey-Glass system
